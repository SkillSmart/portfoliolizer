Workshops

    “
Great Negotiators are made, not born.”

Workshops
The legal field challenges us with unique requirements in everyday negotiations: high stake deals, fierce competition, demanding clients.

My workshops are tailored to this challenge. Together, we take an in-depth and holistic view on daily encounters and important aspects of negotiation situations in a legal environment, across all levels of the firm. Through a combination of discussion, presentation and negotiation case studies my workshops provide you with a roadmap to tackling your most challenging negotiations and equip you with actionable skills and effective strategies for your next negotiations. 

What makes the world’s best legal negotiators?
Preparation
get equipped with the best tips and tools for effective preparation and smart negotiation planning	Effective Communication
Active listening, careful framing, smart questioning, efficient summarizing – you will feel the difference!	Practice
Prepare, plan, perform and evaluate negotiations with your team in a real world scenario - immediate results guaranteed



Practical, intense, results-based
Extensive simulations and case studies involving roles as clients and counsel provide participants with the opportunity to have immediate real-life application, probing and development of their skills. 360° feedback helps you evaluate and accelerate your performance as a negotiator.

How do negotiation skills translate into client satisfaction?
As nuances of legal work, with clients, opposing counsel, authorities and courts become more complex, clients become more demanding. Client satisfaction is no longer based on results only. Process matters. Client focus proves to become the number one criteria for client satisfaction. Learn how the Harvard concept of interest-based negotiation merges gives you a crucial advantage over competitors in achieving higher client satisfaction with a client-interest-based approach. 


At the end of the day my participants go home with 
-	A new awareness for how communication and negotiation influences client satisfaction
-	An improved confidence in their negotiation abilities
-	A toolbox of negotiation skills and tools 
-	Practical experience in applying the skills and tools of the most effective negotiators
