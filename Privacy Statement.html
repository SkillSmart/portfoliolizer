            <h1>PRIVACY STATEMENT & DISCLAIMER</h1>

            <p>This privacy statement informs about how your personal data is collected, used and processed by
                claudiawinkler.net (“the provider”).</p>
            <h3>Access Data</h3>
            <p>The provider and his webspace provider collect data on every visit to the webpage (so called server log
            files). These include: the name of the webpage visited, the date, the time, the quantity of the data
            transferred, the browser type and version, the operating system of the user, the referring URL (the
            page visited prior), the IP address and the requesting provider.
            The provider only uses this data for statistic purposes in the interest of his business, the safety and
            the optimization of his page. The provider retains the right to use this data to investigate illegal
            use of his services.
            Handling of personal data
            Personal data is information that helps to individualize a person. This information includes the name,
            email address and telephone number but also information like hobbies, memberships or webpages visited.
            The provider only collects, uses or forwards such personal data in cases where this is not against the
            law or in cases where the user agrees to the collection of his/her data.
            Communication with the provider</br></br>
            In case of communication with the provider (e.g. via the contact form or email) the data of the user
                will be collected for purposes of processing the query or for possible follow up questions by the user.
            Inclusion of services and content of third parties
            It may occur that content of third parties is included in our online content, i.e. videos from YouTube,
                maps from Google-Maps, RSS-Feeds or graphs from other websites. This means that the providers of
                these services (in the following “third party providers”) collect the IP-address of users to be able
                to send their content to the user’s browser. The IP-address is a necessity for the display of such
                content. We make every effort to only use the content of providers which use the collected IP-addresses
                exclusively for purposes of the delivery of content. However, we do not have any influence in case a
                third party provider collects the IP-address for other, e.g. statistical, purposes.
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small data which enable to save specific device-related data on the user’s access device
                (i.e. PC, smartphone, etc.). These make websites more user-friendly and are therefore in the user’s
                interests (e.g. storage of login-data). They are also used to collect statistical data on the use of
                the website and to analyze the use of a website in order to improve the content. The users can decide
                on the use of the cookies. Most browsers include an option that limits or entirely prevents the storage
                of cookies. Please note, however, that the use of website and particularly the ease of use is
                substantially limited without the use of cookies.
                You can administer several online-cookies of corporations via the U.S. website
                http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU-website http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices/
                Withdrawal, amendments, user rights and updates
                The user has the right to be informed about all personal data stored about him/her without charge.
                In addition, the user has the right to request the correction of incorrect data as well as to request
                the blocking or deletion of personal data, provided that there is no legal obligation of the provider
                to preserve this data.
            </p>
            <h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>
            <p>Any liability for direct or indirect references to external websites (“hyperlinks”), which are outside the responsibility of the author, would be assumed only if the author is aware of the content and would be technically possible and reasonable for him to prevent use in the event of illegal content.
            The website operator herewith expressly declares that, at the time of the placing of the link, there was no noticeable illegal content on the linked pages. The website operator has no influence of any kind on the current and future design, the content or the authorship of the linked pages. Therefore, he herewith distances himself expressly from all contents on all linked pages that have been changed after the placing of the link.
            This statement applies for all links and references set within this website, as well as third-party entries in guest books, discussion forums and mailing lists set up by the website operator. Solely the supplier of the site that has been referenced is liable for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for any damage that arises from the use or this use of information supplied in this way, and not he who merely provides reference to the respective publication using links.
            The website operator reserves the right to change or remove content on this website without notification.</p>
